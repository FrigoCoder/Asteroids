    Thesis Foreword

        This project demonstrates the use of modern Software Engineering principles, techniques and tools, with an emphasis on Entity Component Systems, in the development of simple two dimensional games, specifically a variation of the popular classic Asteroids.

        Modern Software Engineering principles and techniques:
            - Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
            - Integrated Development Environments (IDE)
            - Clean Code & Test Driven Development (TDD)
            - Mock Objects
            - Distributed Revision Control
            - Build Automation Software
            - Continuous Integration (CI)
            - Software Quality Control
            - Entity Component System (ECS)

        Corresponding Software Engineering Tools:
            - Java
            - Eclipse
            - Junit
            - Mockito
            - Mercurial
            - Gradle
            - Jenkins
            - SonarQube
